## Note
* Make sure to run this program as administrator permissions so it would kill any desk perfectly and without any problems. 
* Also, you need to have any desk installed in the "C" drive or change it in the program to your any desk installation folder.
* If any desk gives you a connection error just close it completely via task manager and reopen and it should change.
